# NotGPT

NotGPT is a Rust LLM bot based on the innovative RWKV language model (see [BlinkDL/RWKV-LM](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM)). The `rwkv` care provides bindings to the `rwkv.cpp` implementation that runs
the model on CPU using [ggerganov/ggml](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml).

Crates

- rkwv/sys - Autogenerated bindings to rwkv.cpp
- rwkv - Implements model generation in Rust (including token sampling). Supports multiple sessions
- notgpt-cli - A simple command-line implementation
- notgpt-telegram - An (unneecssarily at the moment) async Telegram implementation with support
  for multiple RNN states per chat (based on the multiple sessions support in `rwkv`)

Todo:

- notgpt-api-server - A standalone server. Due to the nature of RNN models, the API will likely
  be stateful and necessarily differ from OpenAI's or other APIs.
